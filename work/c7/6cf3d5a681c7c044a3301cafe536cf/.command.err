USAGE: MergeSamFiles [options]

Documentation: http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#MergeSamFiles

Merges multiple SAM/BAM/CRAM (and/or) files into a single file.  This tool is used for combining SAM/BAM/CRAM (and/or)
files from different runs or read groups into a single file, similarly to the "merge" function of Samtools
(http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html).  

Note that to prevent errors in downstream processing, it is critical to identify/label read groups appropriately. If
different samples contain identical read group IDs, this tool will avoid collisions by modifying the read group IDs to
be unique. For more information about read groups, see the GATK Dictionary entry.
(https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=6472) 



Usage example:

java -jar picard.jar MergeSamFiles \
I=input_1.bam \
I=input_2.bam \
O=output_merged_files.bam

--help
-h                            Displays options specific to this tool.

--stdhelp
-H                            Displays options specific to this tool AND options common to all Picard command line
                              tools.

--version                     Displays program version.

INPUT=String
I=String                      SAM/BAM/CRAM input file  Default value: null. This option must be specified at least 1
                              times. 

OUTPUT=File
O=File                        SAM/BAM/CRAM file to write merged result to  Required. 

SORT_ORDER=SortOrder
SO=SortOrder                  Sort order of output file  Default value: coordinate. This option can be set to 'null' to
                              clear the default value. Possible values: {unsorted, queryname, coordinate, duplicate,
                              unknown} 

ASSUME_SORTED=Boolean
AS=Boolean                    If true, assume that the input files are in the same sort order as the requested output
                              sort order, even if their headers say otherwise.  Default value: false. This option can be
                              set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} 

MERGE_SEQUENCE_DICTIONARIES=Boolean
MSD=Boolean                   Merge the sequence dictionaries  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to
                              clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} 

USE_THREADING=Boolean         Option to create a background thread to encode, compress and write to disk the output
                              file. The threaded version uses about 20% more CPU and decreases runtime by ~20% when
                              writing out a compressed BAM/CRAM file.  Default value: false. This option can be set to
                              'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} 

COMMENT=String
CO=String                     Comment(s) to include in the merged output file's header.  Default value: null. This
                              option may be specified 0 or more times. 

INTERVALS=File
RGN=File                      An interval list file that contains the locations of the positions to merge. Assume sam
                              are sorted and indexed. The resulting file will contain alignments that may overlap with
                              genomic regions outside the requested region. Unmapped reads are discarded.  Default
                              value: null.
